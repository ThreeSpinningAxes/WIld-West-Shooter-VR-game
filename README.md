# Wild West Draw Shooter
This game is a wild west themed VR first person gun shooter game. The playstyle of the game involves the player turning around after a 3 second countdown to shoot down a falling object with a revolver. If the player successfully shoots the object, the player moves on to the next level (there are a total of 3 levels). If the player lets the object fall to the ground without shooting it or runs out of bullets (6 total), the player loses the game and must restart from level 1. At the start of every level, you will be facing the wall with your hand being hidden until the countdown finishes. As the levels increase, the size of the object decreases and gets harder to shoot down. You win the game after completing all three levels.
